Alcor Exchange has been actively involved in the EOSIO and WAX ecosystems since February 2020 when we launched as a leading decentralized exchange (DEX). Our commitment to supporting the growth and development of the WAX blockchain is evident through our contributions and initiatives.
 
Our involvement in the WAX ecosystem can be summarized as follows:

 
Alcor Exchange Launch: In February 2020, we established ourselves as a prominent DEX on the WAX blockchain, facilitating over 6 billion WAX traded and accounting for 42,305,507 swaps and 41,522,712 order book matches.
 
Supporting New Projects and Developers: Alcor Exchange has been dedicated to fostering the growth of the WAX ecosystem by providing innovative tools and initiatives. We have introduced Swap V2, which incorporates concentrated liquidity, a marketplace, and the implementation of the Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC) bridge.
 
Community-Driven Approach: Our unique insight lies in our community-driven approach, which empowers new developers and content creators to express their ideas and develop projects on the WAX blockchain. We have played a significant role in developing the core of WAX DeFi and continue to support projects that bring value to the chain. Alcor Exchange is available in 7 different languages: Italian, Ukrainiann, Russian, Filipino, Spanish, Chinese, English.

  ### Product Updates

  
Alcor AMM Swap V2: Introducing concentrated liquidity on the WAX Blockchain.     	

![image](https://github.com/Zzullerr/waxguilds/assets/116539401/6dd8e31e-3d96-440a-aa34-5c53e39d7f86)



-Redesigned Swap Page UI: The user interface of the Swap page has been completely revamped, ensuring a convenient and user-friendly experience for users.


-Concentrated Liquidity: Alcor Exchange has implemented a new protocol based on concentrated liquidity, which significantly improves liquidity efficiency. Liquidity providers can now allocate their capital within specific price ranges, resulting in individualized price curves, higher capital efficiency, and deeper liquidity for traders. This concept allows for up to 4,000 times increased liquidity efficiency compared to traditional liquidity pools.


-Revenue Management: With the introduction of concentrated liquidity, liquidity providers can significantly increase their revenue from fees or reduce the risk of losses. The new system allows for convenient management of fees earned on positions, offering various fee tiers to choose from based on risk/profit ratio strategies.


-New Approach to Liquidity and Stablecoin Exchange: Alcor Exchange has implemented a new approach to providing liquidity and exchanging stablecoins. This ensures improved liquidity depth and offers traders a seamless experience.


-Range Orders: Range orders have been introduced as a useful tool similar to limit orders. Liquidity providers can deposit a single token within a user-defined price range above or below the current market price. When the market price enters the specified range, the token starts converting to another asset along a smooth curve, allowing LPs to earn swap fees.


-Multiple Fee Tiers: Alcor Swap AMM liquidity pools offer liquidity providers three different commission levels per pair (0.05%, 0.30%, and 1.00%). This enables LPs to choose the level of risk they are comfortable with, based on the volatility of the pair, optimizing their potential income.


-Oracle Price: AlcorSwap v2 introduces on-chain price oracles known as time-weighted average price (TWAP) oracles. These highly decentralized oracles provide asset price data and offer a solution to challenges related to data validity and authenticity.

### Ecosystem #1: Alcor Yield Farming
Alcor Exchange has a comprehensive plan for yield farming, which aims to provide users with opportunities to earn additional rewards by participating in liquidity provision. The yield farming program allows users to stake their assets in selected liquidity pools and earn additional tokens as rewards. Alcor Exchange will collaborate with various projects and integrate their tokens into the yield farming program, providing a diverse range of options for users to choose from. The program will feature different reward tiers and durations, allowing users to select the most suitable farming strategies based on their risk appetite and preferences. The goal is to incentivize liquidity provision, enhance the overall liquidity of the platform, and offer users the chance to earn passive income through yield farming.

Status: In development. Contract ready to deploy, working on audits to apply for Yield+ program and User Experience.

## Do you have any feedback for improving the Office of Inspector General, the Inspector General Guidelines, or this form.
We received great assistance from the OIG members. We would love to count on more written and audiovisual material to further understand the process without relying on the OIGÂ´s assistance. 
We would love to count with a page for tools that applicants can use to track all the data needed.
